          My name is Ho Ting Edmund Tsoi, and I'm a software engineer with a passion for creating innovative and user-friendly technology solutions. 
          Although I haven&apos;t had any working experience, I have been kept developing my skills through coursework, group projects from college 
          and practices found on the Internet.

          Throughout my studies, I&apos;ve gained a solid understanding of programming languages, software design principles, and the software 
          development life cycle. I have practised on how an actual project works by working on group projects with my classmates with the guidelines
          from professor.

          expertise to work in a professional setting.
